softmod_info_game_description_1=Game Description
softmod_info_game_description_2=Set sail. Collect resources and fuel the ship in order to survive as many leagues as possible. The ship moves with code magic. To upgrade the ship, visit a dock. Each crew has a captain, who can perform actions such as making the boat leave early.\n\nGame progression is significantly slowed down the smaller the crew.\n\n[font=default-bold]Win condition:[/font] Travel 1000 leagues.\n[font=default-bold]Lose condition:[/font] The ship runs out of fuel, or a cannon is destroyed.

softmod_info_bugs_1=Known issues
softmod_info_bugs_2=- Circuit connections don't survive when the ship teleports between surfaces.

softmod_info_new_players_1=For New Players
softmod_info_new_players_2=Mine coal and other resources and bring them to the ship to keep things going, or try asking the captain for more specific tasks.

softmod_info_tips_1=Features of the game that are hard to work out alone
softmod_info_tips_2=• Resources granted to the ship appear in the captain's cabin.\n• Charging a silo launches a rocket. This causes pollution and evo, but each launch gives a reward of fuel and coins.\n• Charging a silo drains power from everything else on its network.\n• Once a silo has launched a rocket, biters will ignore it.\n• You can steer the boat from the crow's nest by placing 100 rail signals in one of the blue boxes.\n• Lab productivity increases with each league.\n• Passive pollution ramps up over time on each island.\n• The strength of attacks is proportional to the number of remaining nests. (Technically the time-based rate of evolution is proportional to nests too, but destroying a nest will immediately jump evolution by roughly the amount it 'would have' made had it survived.) \n• At Abandoned Labs, biters don't care if you emit pollution. They only care how long you stay.\n• To launch a second parallel run, you need a fifth of the server's pirates to endorse it.\n• Help commands: /class

softmod_info_updates_1=Development
softmod_info_updates_2=Pirate Ship 1.0.3 is currently in testing! The gameplay is reworked to center around a fuel mechanic. This should make for a clear central objective. Please play and help us tune the gameplay. \n\nRecent significant changes: Fuel mechanic replaces gold. Silo death is no longer a lose condition. Additional silos can appear to deconstrain power input. Weakened chest/furnace/pipe resistance to biters. Dock trades revamped.
